<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi! My name is Will. I'm originally from the United States, but have been living and working around the world for more than 10 years. Living in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and now Portugal has helped me realize the importance of communication. I have taught in classrooms at elementary schools and universities and also online. I've worked with children and adults of all different language levels from various cultures around the world. Each different situation has taught me so much, and you can use my international experience to help you or your children achieve your language, learning, and life goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have decided to dedicate my life to helping people achieve their goals through communication in English. I created Independent English for this purpose. It&rsquo;s goal is to increase opportunity for everyone involved and to create a more harmonious world and brighter future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. Please contact me if you have any questions or would like to schedule a free initial session.</p>
