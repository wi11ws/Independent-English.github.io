Independent English currently offers 2 courses: ‘Young Readers’ and ‘Confidence and Communication’. Both are designed to be fun, interactive, engaging, and challenging.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The Young Readers course is designed around books, including: The Magic Treehouse, Oxford Reading Tree, Harry Potter, and Captain Underpants series, as well as Fantastic Mr. Fox, Charlotte's Web, and others. This course will help students develop vocabulary, confidence while speaking, listening/reading comprehension, pronunciation, writing skills, and knowledge of grammar. It also provides an opportunity to practice communication, critical thinking, reasoning, typing, and more. The Young Readers course is a great choice for children, but can be adapted for adults or more advanced students who wish to learn this way.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Confidence and Communication is designed to build confidence in speaking ability and improve communication. It can help professionals, academics, students, travelers, and other global citizens access more opportunities all around the world. Though designed with specific core elements, students will take an active role in planning classes to ensure this course is interesting and useful for them.</li>
</ul>
<br>
All classes within each course are customized for each individual student, considering their interests, goals, and learning style. For this reason, Independent English only offers individual lessons for one student at a time. Independent English recommends one or two classes (45 minutes to one hour) per week, depending on each students’ level and situation.
